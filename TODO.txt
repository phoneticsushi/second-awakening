Major Bugs:
 [None!]

Minor Bugs:
  Original game will wait until "Instrument Acquired" theme finishes before playing instrument song
    Because we silence the music, that song is not playing
    This allows you to advance the text box immediately and cut off the "Instrument Acquired" theme
 Because of the way we handle silencing the audio, some fanfares are cut off
    e.g. when unlocking Eagle's Tower
 Some of the song transitions cause slight audio popping
    Milliseconds aren't precise enough
    Solution is to store clip timings in microsecond/sample terms and cut the songs at zero-crossings
    May or may not do this

Potential Future Features:
 Delay Pre-Game Start to get intro to first track in
 Handle Ocarina songs
    These are coded as Jingles and thus require handling separately from the background music
 "Music Showcase" mode in the style of the Let's Play
    Remember the position of the last three songs played
    Resume playing at that position if any song in that list is played

Potential Tweaks:
 Apply heart container fanfare to complete before playing "Instrument on Pedestal"?
 L/R channel audio volumes could control channels directly
    right now they're just averaged and that volume applied globally
    in practice, this isn't an issue, and probably actually sounds better
 Occasional Clicking sounds coming from emulator when music changes
   Might try silencing music immediately on emulator instead of waiting for Python to respond
